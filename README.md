# Campus Indoor-Outdoor Navigation
Room-to-room campus navigation that links building floor plans to OpenStreetMap for seamless indoor-to-outdoor routing. Implement an end-to-end computer vision pipeline to convert floor plans into routable maps and compute real-time paths with A* dynamic edges. Includes a simple Flask API, ReactJS demo, sample data, and a quickstart to run locally.
